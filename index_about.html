    <h1> <b> ABOUT </b> </h1>

    <h2> I'm David Nzekwu, A.K.A Blackdae, and I am a New Media student at Toronto Metropolitan University.
        <p> 
        I love making music, photography, and new media art. As a music producer, I make beats from a wide range of genres but my sound is mainly centered around Hip hop, Jazz, and Afrobeat. 
        <p>
        I am also into audio post production and sound design. </h2>
